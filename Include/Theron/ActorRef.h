/**
\brief Legacy utility for backwards compatibility.

\note In versions of Theron from 4.0 onwards, there is no need to use ActorRef
objects at all. They are provided only for backwards compatibility.

In versions of Theron prior to 4.0, actors couldn't be constructed directly
in user code. Instead you had to ask a Framework to create one for you, using
the Framework::CreateActor method template. Instead of returning the actor itself,
CreateActor returned a <i>reference</i> to the actor in the form of an ActorRef
object.

ActorRefs were lightweight, copyable references to actors. When an ActorRef was
copied (or passed or returned by value) the ActorRef was copied, but the copy
still referenced the same Actor, which was not itself copied. The Actor itself
was reference-counted, and was scheduled for garbage collection when the last
ActorRef referencing it was destructed, and it became unreferenced.

\code
// LEGACY CODE!
class MyActor : public Theron::Actor
{
};

int main()
{
    Theron::Framework framework;
    Theron::ActorRef actorRef(framework.CreateActor<MyActor>());

    // (1) The actorRef goes out of scope and destructed.
    // (2) Actor becomes unreferenced and is scheduled for garbage collection.
    // (3) Framework worker threads garbage collect the unreferenced actor.
    // (4) The framework goes out of scope and is destructed.
}
\endcode

In versions of Theron starting with 4.0, Actors are first-class citizens and
behave like vanilla C++ objects. They can be constructed directly with no
call to Framework::CreateActor. Once constructed they are referenced directly
by user code with no need for ActorRef proxy objects. Finally, like traditional
C++ objects, once they go out of scope or are deleted they are destructed
immediately rather than in a deferred fashion by a separate garbage collection
process.

When writing new code, follow the new, simpler construction pattern where actors
are constructed directly and not referenced by ActorRefs:

\code
// New code
class MyActor : public Theron::Actor
{
public:

    MyActor(Theron::Framework &framework) : Theron::Actor(framework)
    {
    }
};

int main()
{
    Theron::Framework framework;
    MyActor actor(framework);

    // (1) The actor goes out of scope and destructed.
    // (4) the Framework goes out of scope and is destructed.
}
\endcode

    \brief Pushes a message into the referenced actor.

    This method is an alternative to \ref Framework::Send, which is the more
    conventional and general way to send messages to actors. \ref Push can be
    called in situations where the caller happens to have an ActorRef referencing
    the actor they want to message.

    \note The return value of this method should be understood to mean
    just that the message was *accepted* by the actor. This doesn't mean
    necessarily that the actor took any action in response to the message.
    If the actor has no handlers registered for messages of that type, then
    the message will simply be consumed without any effect. In such cases
    this method will still return true. This surprising behavior is a result
    of the asynchronous nature of message sending: the sender doesn't wait
    for the recipient to process the message. It is the sender's
    responsibility to ensure that messages are appropriate for the actors to
    which they are sent. Actor implementations can also register a default
    message handler (see \ref Actor::SetDefaultHandler).
