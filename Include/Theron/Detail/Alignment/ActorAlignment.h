/**
\brief Traits struct template that stores alignment information about actors.

Users can specialize this template for their own actor types in order to tell
Theron about any specialized alignment requirements of those classes.
Theron uses the alignment value defined for each actor type to request memory
with the correct alignment from the general allocator registered with the
\ref AllocatorManager. The default alignment is four bytes, implying that
instances of the actor class should be allocated starting at 4-byte boundaries.
\note Note that although Theron will request memory allocated with the correct
alignment, whether or not the allocator respects the alignment request is up
to the allocator implementation. The default allocator, DefaultAllocator,
supports alignment and returns correctly aligned allocations. Users with
specialized alignment requirements should ensure that any custom allocator,
implementing the \ref IAllocator interface, and enabled with
\ref Theron::AllocatorManager::SetAllocator, supports aligned allocations.

\tparam ActorType The actor type for which the alignment traits are defined.
